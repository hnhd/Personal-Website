				<div class = "description">I'm a political science major with a concentration in quantitative methodology at University of California, Berkeley. After graduating, I'm hoping to get a job as a data analyst, predominantly working with programs like R and the like. As society attempts to quantify more types of information, understanding how to measure, collect, and analyze data will be some of the most useful skills one can acquire. I aim to work as an education policy data analyst and have hopes of working for education non-profits in the future.</div>
