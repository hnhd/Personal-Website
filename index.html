				<div class = "description">An outgoing, curious, and enthusiastic individual with mind for people and heart for data analytics, I am a proud Palestinian-American with a strong interest to better human lives through cogent, well-researched policy decisions. It's important to temper extreme beliefs and ideology with context, evidence, and thorough analysis to create solutions that work and remain long after their implementation.
				<p>
				After my graduation from the University of California, Berkeley, I intend to develop my skills as a data analyst, working with statistical programs, database software, and-of course-Excel, to produce meaningful statistical analyses and beautiful data visualization to answer valuable substantive questions. In particular, I'm most interested in producing products that are not only cogent and well-researched, but also aesthetically appealing and conceptually sound.
				<p>
				I am interested in discussions surrounding improvements to structural issues in the American school system and Arab American political mobilization. I aim to contribute substantially to both discourses to provide much needed research and motivation to better both the American education system and Arab American representation in the United States.
				<p>
				If you're interested in getting to know me, please feel free to send me an email at hannahaddad@berkeley.edu. I am always willing to grab a cup of coffee for a fun conversation and a new friend.</div>

I was able to see Bernie Sanders, a candidate I supported wholeheartedly, get closer to clinching the Democratic nomination than any pundit would have ever expected. I followed the polls religiously and was quick to jump onto the New York Times National Results Map, to pour through the results of their nicely-colored interactive map.</div>
